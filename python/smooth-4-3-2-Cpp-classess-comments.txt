1. Created an adam class in C++. This is now in the adamCore.hpp file in the src folder.
2. All headers are now in the subfolder /src/headers
3. Substituted adamFitter, forecaster etc with the adam methods.
4. Created adamCpp object (initialised the class) inside the architector (line 751). This is now passed to further functions and used in subfunctions. This is also now passed to:
a. CF,
b. logLikADAM
c. preparator
d. hessian() that calls for logLikADAM
e. creator (because of the polynomials)
f. initialiser (because of the polynomials)
g. filler (because of the polynomials)
5. Same adamCpp object is now used in the forecast method for the adam itself.
6. simulate method for adam now also uses the class and the respective method
7. adamPolynomialiser was substituted by adamCpp$polynomialise - another method for the adamCpp class
8. fitter now returns objects called states, fitted, errors and profile instead of matVt, yFitted, errors and profileRecent. This is for consistency across methods. All internal stuff in the CF needs to be amended to reflect that.
9. simulate() now returns states instead of arrayVt
10. errorer returns object "errors"
11. adamCpp class now sets common parameters (coming from the architector), which are now used in all the methods. This means that the methods now accept fewer parameters. Here is the list of parameters that need to be provided in the exact order:
- lagsModelAll,
- Etype,
- Ttype,
- Stype,
- componentsNumberETSNonSeasonal,
- componentsNumberETSSeasonal,
- componentsNumberETS,
- componentsNumberARIMA,
- xregNumber,
- constantRequired,
- adamETS
12. Note that polynomialise method has its own lags variable, which is not the same as the lagsModellAll
13. Another note: simulate has a separate parameter Etype, which might differ from the original for some weird ADAM cases (e.g. additive error with Log-Normal distribution)
14. estimator now returns adamCpp object to pass it to selector and other functions that might need it
15. creator() now requires adamCpp
16. componentsDefiner now also returns componentsNumberETSNonSeasonal
17. I have already created the adamPython.cpp file in the src folder, so you would need to point to that instead of the "python_example" folder.
18. I have also updated the CMakeLists.txt file, which should compile (Claude helped me) and provide the _adamCore. Please check.

### How to create the new class in Python:

from . import _adamCore
import numpy as np

# Instantiate adamCore internally
adam_model = _adamCore.adamCore(
    lags=lagsModelAll,
    E=Etype,
    T=Ttype,
    S=Stype,
    nNonSeasonal=componentsNumberETSNonSeasonal,
    nSeasonal=componentsNumberETSSeasonal,
    nETS=componentsNumberETS,
    nArima=componentsNumberARIMA,
    nXreg=xregNumber,
    constant=constantRequired,
    adamETS=adamETS
)
