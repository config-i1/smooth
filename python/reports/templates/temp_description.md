# Initial Explanation Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare.

Here is exactly what I need implemented:

read @CLAUDE.md. and @python/smooth_package_structure.md. We are translating the ets version of adam in @R/adam.R into python. I have finished adding only a single prediction interval method in python in constrat with R. In R, we hve more than one. lets focus on "simmulation" method.. I would like to have the same feature in python. It should have the same functionality as in R but with the way the python module is structured. Understand the codebase and the structure of the python module. Then understand how the feature is implemented in R.

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.
