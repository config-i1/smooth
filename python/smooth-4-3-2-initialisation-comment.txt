Affected lines in adam.R: 900 - 1146 (creator function).

Things changed: how initial values of matVt defined depending on the ETS type. This only applies to the level and trend components. These now use gta and gtm variables from the msdecompose(), which contain the initial estimates of parameter for the "Global Trend, Additive" and "Global Trend, Multiplicative" respectively.
Lines in the new code: 911 - 914, 935, 945, 950, 955.
In addition, lines 1101 - 1104 and 1140 - 1143 introduce failsafe mechanisms in case of negative initial level.
Furthermore, the large chunk of code (901, 1016-1099) is now commented out because this is handled by the msdecompose function.
Finally, the default smoother in ADAM (calling for msdecompose) now is lowess.
