\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector or ts object, containing data needed to be forecasted.}

\item{model}{The type of ETS model. The first letter stands for the type of
the error term ("A" or "M"), the second (and sometimes the third as well) is for
the trend ("N", "A", "Ad", "M" or "Md"), and the last one is for the type of
seasonality ("N", "A" or "M"). So, the function accepts words with 3 or 4
characters: \code{ANN}, \code{AAN}, \code{AAdN}, \code{AAA}, \code{AAdA},
\code{MAdM} etc. \code{ZZZ} means that the model will be selected based on the
chosen information criteria type. Models pool can be restricted with additive
only components. This is done via \code{model="XXX"}. For example, making
selection between models with none / additive / damped additive trend
component only (i.e. excluding multiplicative trend) can be done with
\code{model="ZXZ"}. Furthermore, selection between multiplicative models
(excluding additive components) is regulated using \code{model="YYY"}. This
can be useful for positive data with low values (for example, slow moving
products). Finally, if \code{model="CCC"}, then all the models are estimated
and combination of their forecasts using AIC weights is produced (Kolassa,
2011). This can also be regulated. For example, \code{model="CCN"} will
combine forecasts of all non-seasonal models and \code{model="CXY"} will
combine forecasts of all the models with non-multiplicative trend and
non-additive seasonality with either additive or multiplicative error. Not
sure why anyone would need this thing, but it is available.

The parameter \code{model} can also be a vector of names of models for a
finer tuning (pool of models). For example, \code{model=c("ANN","AAA")} will
estimate only two models and select the best of them.

Also \code{model} can accept a previously estimated ES or ETS (from forecast
package) model and use all its parameters.

Keep in mind that model selection with "Z" components uses Branch and Bound
algorithm and may skip some models that could have slightly smaller
information criteria.}

\item{lags}{Defines lags for the corresponding components. All components
count, starting from level, so ETS(M,M,M) model for monthly data will have
\code{lags=c(1,1,12)}. However, the function will also accept \code{lags=c(12)},
assuming that the lags 1 were dropped.}

\item{persistence}{Persistence vector \eqn{g}, containing smoothing
parameters. If \code{NULL}, then estimated.}

\item{phi}{Value of damping parameter. If \code{NULL} then it is estimated.}

\item{initial}{Can be either character or a vector of initial states.
If it is character, then it can be \code{"optimal"}, meaning that all initial
states are optimised, or \code{"backcasting"}, meaning that the initials of
dynamic part of the model are produced using backcasting procedure (advised
for data with high frequency). In the latter case, the parameters of the
explanatory variables are optimised. This is recommended for ETSX
model. Alternatively, you can set \code{initial="complete"} backcasting,
which means that all states (including explanatory variables) are initialised
via backcasting. You can also provide a vector with values for level and trend
components.
If character, then \code{initialSeason} will be estimated in the way defined
by \code{initial}.}

\item{initialSeason}{Vector of initial values for seasonal components. If
\code{NULL}, they are estimated during optimisation.}

\item{ic}{The information criterion used in the model selection procedure.}

\item{loss}{The type of Loss Function used in optimization. \code{loss} can
be: \code{likelihood} (assuming Normal distribution of error term),
\code{MSE} (Mean Squared Error), \code{MAE} (Mean Absolute Error),
\code{HAM} (Half Absolute Moment), \code{TMSE} - Trace Mean Squared Error,
\code{GTMSE} - Geometric Trace Mean Squared Error, \code{MSEh} - optimisation
using only h-steps ahead error, \code{MSCE} - Mean Squared Cumulative Error.
If \code{loss!="MSE"}, then likelihood and model selection is done based
on equivalent \code{MSE}. Model selection in this cases becomes not optimal.

There are also available analytical approximations for multistep functions:
\code{aMSEh}, \code{aTMSE} and \code{aGTMSE}. These can be useful in cases
of small samples.

Finally, just for fun the absolute and half analogues of multistep estimators
are available: \code{MAEh}, \code{TMAE}, \code{GTMAE}, \code{MACE}, \code{TMAE},
\code{HAMh}, \code{THAM}, \code{GTHAM}, \code{CHAM}.}

\item{h}{Length of forecasting horizon.}

\item{holdout}{If \code{TRUE}, holdout sample of size \code{h} is taken from
the end of the data.}

\item{bounds}{What type of bounds to use in the model estimation. The first
letter can be used instead of the whole word.}

\item{silent}{If \code{silent="none"}, then nothing is silent, everything is
printed out and drawn. \code{silent="all"} means that nothing is produced or
drawn (except for warnings). In case of \code{silent="graph"}, no graph is
produced. If \code{silent="legend"}, then legend of the graph is skipped.
And finally \code{silent="output"} means that nothing is printed out in the
console, but the graph is produced. \code{silent} also accepts \code{TRUE}
and \code{FALSE}. In this case \code{silent=TRUE} is equivalent to
\code{silent="all"}, while \code{silent=FALSE} is equivalent to
\code{silent="none"}. The parameter also accepts first letter of words ("n",
"a", "g", "l", "o").}

\item{xreg}{The vector (either numeric or time series) or the matrix (or
data.frame) of exogenous variables that should be included in the model. If
matrix included than columns should contain variables and rows - observations.
Note that \code{xreg} should have number of observations equal either to
in-sample or to the whole series. If the number of observations in
\code{xreg} is equal to in-sample, then values for the holdout sample are
produced using \link[smooth]{es} function.}

\item{regressors}{The variable defines what to do with the provided xreg:
\code{"use"} means that all of the data should be used, while
\code{"select"} means that a selection using \code{ic} should be done.
\code{"combine"} will be available at some point in future...}

\item{initialX}{The vector of initial parameters for exogenous variables.
Ignored if \code{xreg} is NULL.}

\item{...}{Other non-documented parameters. For example \code{FI=TRUE} will
make the function also produce Fisher Information matrix, which then can be
used to calculated variances of smoothing parameters and initial states of
the model.
Parameters \code{B}, \code{lb} and \code{ub} can be passed via
ellipsis as well. In this case they will be used for optimisation. \code{B}
sets the initial values before the optimisation, \code{lb} and
\code{ub} define lower and upper bounds for the search inside of the
specified \code{bounds}. These values should have length equal to the number
of parameters to estimate.
You can also pass two parameters to the optimiser: 1. \code{maxeval} - maximum
number of evaluations to carry on; 2. \code{xtol_rel} - the precision of the
optimiser. The default values used in es() are \code{maxeval=500} and
\code{xtol_rel=1e-8}. You can read more about these parameters in the
documentation of \link[nloptr]{nloptr} function.}

\item{cumulative}{If \code{TRUE}, then the cumulative forecast and prediction
interval are produced instead of the normal ones. This is useful for
inventory control systems.}

\item{interval}{Type of interval to construct. This can be:

\itemize{
\item \code{"none"}, aka \code{"n"} - do not produce prediction
interval.
\item \code{"parametric"}, \code{"p"} - use state-space structure of ETS. In
case of mixed models this is done using simulations, which may take longer
time than for the pure additive and pure multiplicative models. This type
of interval relies on unbiased estimate of in-sample error variance, which
divides the sume of squared errors by T-k rather than just T.
\item \code{"likelihood"}, \code{"l"} - these are the same as \code{"p"}, but
relies on the biased estimate of variance from the likelihood (division by
T, not by T-k).
\item \code{"semiparametric"}, \code{"sp"} - interval based on covariance
matrix of 1 to h steps ahead errors and assumption of normal / log-normal
distribution (depending on error type).
\item \code{"nonparametric"}, \code{"np"} - interval based on values from a
quantile regression on error matrix (see Taylor and Bunn, 1999). The model
used in this process is e[j] = a j^b, where j=1,..,h.
}
The parameter also accepts \code{TRUE} and \code{FALSE}. The former means that
parametric interval are constructed, while the latter is equivalent to
\code{none}.
If the forecasts of the models were combined, then the interval are combined
quantile-wise (Lichtendahl et al., 2013).}

\item{level}{Confidence level. Defines width of prediction interval.}
}

\description{
Function constructs ETS model and returns forecast, fitted values, errors
and matrix of states. It is a wrapper of \link[smooth]{adam} function.
}
\details{
Function estimates ETS in a form of the Single Source of Error state space
model of the following type:

\deqn{y_{t} = o_t (w(v_{t-l}) + h(x_t, a_{t-1}) + r(v_{t-l}) \epsilon_{t})}

\deqn{v_{t} = f(v_{t-l}) + g(v_{t-l}) \epsilon_{t}}

\deqn{a_{t} = F_{X} a_{t-1} + g_{X} \epsilon_{t} / x_{t}}

Where \eqn{o_{t}} is the Bernoulli distributed random variable (in case of
normal data it equals to 1 for all observations), \eqn{v_{t}} is the state
vector and \eqn{l} is the vector of lags, \eqn{x_t} is the vector of
exogenous variables. w(.) is the measurement function, r(.) is the error
function, f(.) is the transition function, g(.) is the persistence
function and h(.) is the explanatory variables function. \eqn{a_t} is the
vector of parameters for exogenous variables, \eqn{F_{X}} is the
\code{transitionX} matrix and \eqn{g_{X}} is the \code{persistenceX} matrix.
Finally, \eqn{\epsilon_{t}} is the error term.

For the details see Hyndman et al.(2008).

For some more information about the model and its implementation, see the
vignette: \code{vignette("es","smooth")}.

Also, there are posts about the functions of the package smooth on the
website of Ivan Svetunkov:
\url{https://forecasting.svetunkov.ru/en/tag/smooth/} - they explain the
underlying models and how to use the functions.
