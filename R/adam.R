#' ADAM is Augmented Dynamic Adaptive Model
#'
#' Function constructs an advanced Single Source of Error model, based on ETS
#' taxonomy and ARIMA elements
#'
#' Function estimates ADAM in a form of the Single Source of Error state space
#' model of the following type:
#'
#' \deqn{y_{t} = o_t (w(v_{t-l}) + h(x_t, a_{t-1}) + r(v_{t-l}) \epsilon_{t})}
#'
#' \deqn{v_{t} = f(v_{t-l}, a_{t-1}) + g(v_{t-l}, a_{t-1}, x_{t}) \epsilon_{t}}
#'
#' Where \eqn{o_{t}} is the Bernoulli distributed random variable (in case of
#' normal data it equals to 1 for all observations), \eqn{v_{t}} is the state
#' vector and \eqn{l} is the vector of lags, \eqn{x_t} is the vector of
#' exogenous variables. w(.) is the measurement function, r(.) is the error
#' function, f(.) is the transition function, g(.) is the persistence
#' function and \eqn{a_t} is the vector of parameters for exogenous variables.
#' Finally, \eqn{\epsilon_{t}} is the error term.
#'
#' The implemented model allows introducing several seasonal states and supports
#' intermittent data via the \code{occurrence} variable.
#'
#' The error term \eqn{\epsilon_t} can follow different distributions, which
#' are regulated via the \code{distribution} parameter. This includes:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item \code{default} - Normal distribution is used for the Additive error models,
#' Gamma is used for the Multiplicative error models.
#' \item dnorm - \link[stats]{Normal} distribution,
#' \item \link[greybox]{dlaplace} - Laplace distribution,
#' \item \link[greybox]{ds} - S distribution,
#' \item \link[greybox]{dgnorm} - Generalised Normal distribution,
# \item \link[stats]{dlogis} - Logistic Distribution,
# \item \link[stats]{dt} - T distribution,
# \item \link[greybox]{dalaplace} - Asymmetric Laplace distribution,
#' \item \link[stats]{dlnorm} - Log-Normal distribution,
# \item dllaplace - Log-Laplace distribution,
# \item dls - Log-S distribution,
# \item dlgnorm - Log-Generalised Normal distribution,
# \item \link[greybox]{dbcnorm} - Box-Cox normal distribution,
#' \item \link[stats]{dgamma} - Gamma distribution,
#' \item \link[statmod]{dinvgauss} - Inverse Gaussian distribution,
#' }
#'
#' For some more information about the model and its implementation, see the
#' vignette: \code{vignette("adam","smooth")}. The more detailed explanation
#' of ADAM is provided by Svetunkov (2021).
#'
#' The function \code{auto.adam()} tries out models with the specified
#' distributions and returns the one with the most suitable one based on selected
#' information criterion.
#'
#' \link[greybox]{sm}.adam method estimates the scale model for the already
#' estimated adam. In order for ADAM to take the SM model into account, the
#' latter needs to be recorded in the former, amending the likelihood and the number
#' of degrees of freedom. This can be done using \link[greybox]{implant} method.

#'
#' @param data Vector, containing data needed to be forecasted. If a matrix (or
#' data.frame / data.table) is provided, then the first column is used as a
#' response variable, while the rest of the matrix is used as a set of explanatory
#' variables. \code{formula} can be used in the latter case in order to define what
#' relation to have.
#' @param model The type of ETS model. The first letter stands for the type of
#' the error term ("A" or "M"), the second (and sometimes the third as well) is for
#' the trend ("N", "A", "Ad", "M" or "Md"), and the last one is for the type of
#' seasonality ("N", "A" or "M"). In case of several lags, the seasonal components
#' are assumed to be the same. The model is then printed out as
#' ETS(M,Ad,M)[m1,m2,...], where m1, m2, ... are the lags specified by the
#' \code{lags} parameter.
#' There are several options for the \code{model} besides the conventional ones,
#' which rely on information criteria:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item \code{model="ZZZ"} means that the model will be selected based on the
#' chosen information criteria type. The Branch and Bound is used in the process.
#' \item \code{model="XXX"} means that only additive components are tested, using
#' Branch and Bound.
#' \item \code{model="YYY"} implies selecting between multiplicative components.
#' \item \code{model="CCC"} triggers the combination of forecasts of models using
#' information criteria weights (Kolassa, 2011).
#' \item combinations between these four and the classical components are also
#' accepted. For example, \code{model="CAY"} will combine models with additive
#' trend and either none or multiplicative seasonality.
#' \item \code{model="PPP"} will produce the selection between pure additive and
#' pure multiplicative models. "P" stands for "Pure". This cannot be mixed with
#' other types of components.
#' \item \code{model="FFF"} will select between all the 30 types of models. "F"
#' stands for "Full". This cannot be mixed with other types of components.
#' \item The parameter \code{model} can also be a vector of names of models for a
#' finer tuning (pool of models). For example, \code{model=c("ANN","AAA")} will
#' estimate only two models and select the best of them.
#' }
#'
#' Also, \code{model} can accept a previously estimated adam and use all
#' its parameters.
#'
#' Keep in mind that model selection with "Z" components uses Branch and Bound
#' algorithm and may skip some models that could have slightly smaller
#' information criteria. If you want to do a exhaustive search, you would need
#' to list all the models to check as a vector.
#'
#' The default value is set to \code{"ZXZ"}, because the multiplicative trend is explosive
#' and dangerous. It should be used only for each separate time series, not for the
#' automated predictions for big  datasets.
#'
#' @param lags Defines lags for the corresponding components. All components
#' count, starting from level, so ETS(M,M,M) model for monthly data will have
#' \code{lags=c(1,1,12)}. However, the function will also accept \code{lags=c(12)},
#' assuming that the lags 1 were dropped. In case of ARIMA, lags specify what should be
#' the seasonal component lag. e.g. \code{lags=c(1,12)} will lead to the
#' seasonal ARIMA with m=12. This can accept several lags, supporting multiple seasonal ETS
#' and ARIMA models.
#' @param orders The order of ARIMA to be included in the model. This should be passed
#' either as a vector (in which case the non-seasonal ARIMA is assumed) or as a list of
#' a type \code{orders=list(ar=c(p,P),i=c(d,D),ma=c(q,Q))}, in which case the \code{lags}
#' variable is used in order to determine the seasonality m. See \link[smooth]{msarima}
#' for details.
#' In addition, \code{orders} accepts one more parameter: \code{orders=list(select=FALSE)}.
#' If \code{TRUE}, then the function will select the most appropriate order using a
#' mechanism similar to \code{auto.msarima()}, but implemented in \code{auto.adam()}.
#' The values \code{list(ar=...,i=...,ma=...)} specify the maximum orders to check in
#' this case.
#' @param formula Formula to use in case of explanatory variables. If \code{NULL},
#' then all the variables are used as is. Can also include \code{trend}, which would add
#' the global trend. Only needed if \code{data} is a matrix or if \code{trend} is provided.
#' @param constant Logical, determining, whether the constant is needed in the model or not.
#' This is mainly needed for ARIMA part of the model, but can be used for ETS as well. In
#' case of pure regression, this is completely ignored (use \code{formula} instead).
#' @param distribution what density function to assume for the error term. The full
#' name of the distribution should be provided, starting with the letter "d" -
#' "density". The names align with the names of distribution functions in R.
#' For example, see \link[stats]{dnorm}. For detailed explanation of available
#' distributions, see vignette in greybox package: \code{vignette("greybox","alm")}.
#' @param loss The type of Loss Function used in optimization. \code{loss} can
#' be:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{likelihood} - the model is estimated via the maximisation of the
#' likelihood of the function specified in \code{distribution};
#' \item \code{MSE} (Mean Squared Error),
#' \item \code{MAE} (Mean Absolute Error),
#' \item \code{HAM} (Half Absolute Moment),
#' \item \code{LASSO} - use LASSO to shrink the parameters of the model;
#' \item \code{RIDGE} - use RIDGE to shrink the parameters of the model;
#' \item \code{TMSE} - Trace Mean Squared Error,
#' \item \code{GTMSE} - Geometric Trace Mean Squared Error,
#' \item \code{MSEh} - optimisation using only h-steps ahead error,
#' \item \code{MSCE} - Mean Squared Cumulative Error.
#' }
#' In case of LASSO / RIDGE, the variables are not normalised prior to the estimation,
#' but the parameters are divided by the mean values of explanatory variables.
#'
#' Note that model selection and combination works properly only for the default
#' \code{loss="likelihood"}.
#'
#' Furthermore, just for fun the absolute and half analogues of multistep estimators
#' are available: \code{MAEh}, \code{TMAE}, \code{GTMAE}, \code{MACE},
#' \code{HAMh}, \code{THAM}, \code{GTHAM}, \code{CHAM}.
#'
#' Last but not least, user can provide their own function here as well, making sure
#' that it accepts parameters \code{actual}, \code{fitted} and \code{B}. Here is an
#' example:
#'
#' \code{lossFunction <- function(actual, fitted, B) return(mean(abs(actual-fitted)))}
#'
#' \code{loss=lossFunction}
#' @param h The forecast horizon. Mainly needed for the multistep loss functions.
#' @param holdout Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the holdout of the size \code{h}
#' is taken from the data (can be used for the model testing purposes).
#' @param persistence Persistence vector \eqn{g}, containing smoothing
#' parameters. If \code{NULL}, then estimated. Can be also passed as a names list of
#' the type: \code{persistence=list(level=0.1, trend=0.05, seasonal=c(0.1,0.2),
#' xreg=c(0.1,0.2))}. Dropping some elements from the named list will make the function
#' estimate them. e.g. if you don't specify seasonal in the persistence for the ETS(M,N,M)
#' model, it will be estimated.
#' @param phi Value of damping parameter. If \code{NULL} then it is estimated.
#' Only applicable for damped-trend models.
#' @param initial Can be either character or a list, or a vector of initial states.
#' If it is character, then it can be \code{"optimal"}, meaning that all initial
#' states are optimised, or \code{"backcasting"}, meaning that the initials of
#' dynamic part of the model are produced using backcasting procedure (advised
#' for data with high frequency). In the latter case, the parameters of the
#' explanatory variables are optimised. This is recommended for ETSX and ARIMAX
#' models. Alternatively, you can set \code{initial="complete"} backcasting,
#' which means that all states (including explanatory variables) are initialised
#' via backcasting.
#'
#' If a use provides a list of values, it is recommended to use the named one and
#' to provide the initial components that are available. For example:
#' \code{initial=list(level=1000,trend=10,seasonal=list(c(1,2),c(1,2,3,4)),
#' arima=1,xreg=100)}. If some of the components are needed by the model, but are
#' not provided in the list, they will be estimated. If the vector is provided,
#' then it is expected that the components will be provided inthe same order as above,
#' one after another without any gaps.
#' @param arma Either the named list or a vector with AR / MA parameters ordered lag-wise.
#' The number of elements should correspond to the specified orders e.g.
#' \code{orders=list(ar=c(1,1),ma=c(1,1)), lags=c(1,4), arma=list(ar=c(0.9,0.8),ma=c(-0.3,0.3))}
#' @param occurrence The type of model used in probability estimation. Can be
#' \code{"none"} - none,
#' \code{"fixed"} - constant probability,
#' \code{"general"} - the general Beta model with two parameters,
#' \code{"odds-ratio"} - the Odds-ratio model with b=1 in Beta distribution,
#' \code{"inverse-odds-ratio"} - the model with a=1 in Beta distribution,
#' \code{"direct"} - the TSB-like (Teunter et al., 2011) probability update
#' mechanism a+b=1,
#' \code{"auto"} - the automatically selected type of occurrence model.
#'
#' The type of model used in the occurrence is equal to the one provided in the
#' \code{model} parameter.
#'
#' Also, a model produced using \link[smooth]{oes} or \link[greybox]{alm} function
#' can be used here.
#' @param ic The information criterion to use in the model selection / combination
#' procedure.
#' @param bounds The type of bounds for the persistence to use in the model
#' estimation. Can be either \code{admissible} - guaranteeing the stability of the
#' model, \code{traditional} - restricting the values with (0, 1) or \code{none} - no
#' restrictions (potentially dangerous).
#' @param regressors The variable defines what to do with the provided explanatory
#' variables:
#' \code{"use"} means that all of the data should be used, while
#' \code{"select"} means that a selection using \code{ic} should be done,
#' \code{"adapt"} will trigger the mechanism of time varying parameters for the
#' explanatory variables.
#' @param silent Specifies, whether to provide the progress of the function or not.
#' If \code{TRUE}, then the function will print what it does and how much it has
#' already done.
#' @param ...  Other non-documented parameters. For example, \code{FI=TRUE} will
#' make the function also produce Fisher Information matrix, which then can be
#' used to calculated variances of smoothing parameters and initial states of
#' the model. This is calculated based on the hessian of log-likelihood function and
#' accepts \code{stepSize} parameter, determining how it is calculated. The default value
#' is \code{stepSize=.Machine$double.eps^(1/4)}. This is used in the \link[stats]{vcov} method.
#' Starting values of parameters can be passed via \code{B}, while the upper and lower
#' bounds should be passed in \code{ub} and \code{lb} respectively. In this case they
#' will be used for optimisation. These values should have the length equal
#' to the number of parameters to estimate in the following order:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item All smoothing parameters (for the states and then for the explanatory variables);
#' \item Damping parameter (if needed);
#' \item ARMA parameters;
#' \item All the initial values (for the states and then for the explanatory variables).
#' }
#' You can also pass parameters to the optimiser in order to fine tune its work:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{maxeval} - maximum number of evaluations to carry out. The default is 40 per
#' estimated parameter for ETS and / or ARIMA and at least 1000 if explanatory variables
#' are introduced in the model (100 per parameter for explanatory variables, but not less
#' than 1000);
#' \item \code{maxtime} - stop, when the optimisation time (in seconds) exceeds this;
#' \item \code{xtol_rel} - the relative precision of the optimiser (the default is 1E-6);
#' \item \code{xtol_abs} - the absolute precision of the optimiser (the default is 1E-8);
#' \item \code{ftol_rel} - the stopping criterion in case of the relative change in the loss
#' function (the default is 1E-8);
#' \item \code{ftol_abs} - the stopping criterion in case of the absolute change in the loss
#' function (the default is 0 - not used);
#' \item \code{algorithm} - the algorithm to use in optimisation
#' (by default, \code{"NLOPT_LN_SBPLX"} is used);
#' \item \code{print_level} - the level of output for the optimiser (0 by default).
#' If equal to 41, then the detailed results of the optimisation are returned.
#' }
#' You can read more about these parameters by running the function
#' \link[nloptr]{nloptr.print.options}.
#' Finally, the parameter \code{lambda} for LASSO / RIDGE, \code{alpha} for the Asymmetric
#' Laplace, \code{shape} for the Generalised Normal and \code{nu} for Student's distributions
#' can be provided here as well.
#'
#' @return Object of class "adam" is returned. It contains the list of the
#' following values:

#' Multiple steps ahead forecast errors
#'
#' The function extracts 1 to h steps ahead forecast errors from the model.
#'
#' The errors correspond to the error term epsilon_t in the ETS models. Don't forget
#' that different models make different assumptions about epsilon_t and / or 1+epsilon_t.

#' @param object Model estimated using one of the forecasting functions.
#' @param h The forecasting horizon to use.
#' @param ... Currently nothing is accepted via ellipsis.
#' @return The matrix with observations in rows and h steps ahead values in columns.

#' @param newdata The new data needed in order to produce forecasts.
#' @param nsim Number of iterations to do in cases of \code{interval="simulated"},
#' \code{interval="prediction"} (for mixed and multiplicative model),
#' \code{interval="confidence"} and \code{interval="complete"}.
#' The default value for the prediction / simulated interval is 1000. In case of
#' confidence or complete intervals, this is set to 100.
#' @param interval What type of mechanism to use for interval construction.
#' the recommended option is \code{interval="prediction"}, which will use analytical
#' solutions for pure additive models and simulations for the others.
#' \code{interval="simulated"} is the slowest method, but is robust to the type of
#' model. \code{interval="approximate"} (aka \code{interval="parametric"}) uses
#' analytical formulae for conditional h-steps ahead variance, but is approximate
#' for the non-additive error models. \code{interval="semiparametric"} relies on the
#' multiple steps ahead forecast error (extracted via \code{rmultistep} method) and on
#' the assumed distribution of the error term. \code{interval="nonparametric"} uses
#' Taylor & Bunn (1999) approach with quantile regressions. \code{interval="empirical"}
#' constructs intervals based on empirical quantiles of multistep forecast errors.
#' \code{interval="complete"} will call for \code{reforecast()} function and produce
#' interval based on the uncertainty around the parameters of the model.
#' Finally, \code{interval="confidence"} tries to generate the confidence intervals
#' for the point forecast based on the \code{reforecast} method.
#' @param cumulative If \code{TRUE}, then the cumulative forecast and prediction
#' interval are produced instead of the normal ones. This is useful for
#' inventory control systems.
#' @param occurrence The vector containing the future occurrence variable
#' (values in [0,1]), if it is known.
#' @param scenarios Binary, defining whether to return scenarios produced via
#' simulations or not. Only works if \code{interval="simulated"}. If \code{TRUE}
#' the object will contain \code{scenarios} variable.

#### Refitter and reforecaster ####
#' Reapply the model with randomly generated initial parameters and produce forecasts
#'
#' \code{reapply} function generates the parameters based on the values in the provided
#' object and then reapplies the same model with those parameters to the data, getting
#' the fitted paths and updated states. \code{reforecast} function uses those values
#' in order to produce forecasts for the \code{h} steps ahead.
#'
#' The main motivation of the function is to take the randomness due to the in-sample
#' estimation of parameters into account when fitting the model and to propagate
#' this randomness to the forecasts. The methods can be considered as a special case
#' of recursive bootstrap.
#'
#' @template ssAuthor
#' @template ssKeywords
#'
#' @param object Model estimated using one of the functions of smooth package.
#' @param nsim Number of paths to generate (number of simulations to do).
#' @param h Forecast horizon.
#' @param newdata The new data needed in order to produce forecasts.
#' @param bootstrap The logical, which determines, whether to use bootstrap for the
#' covariance matrix of parameters or not.
#' @param heuristics The value for proportion to use for heuristic estimation of the
#' standard deviation of parameters. If \code{NULL}, it is not used.
#' @param occurrence The vector containing the future occurrence variable
#' (values in [0,1]), if it is known.
#' @param interval What type of mechanism to use for interval construction. The options
#' include \code{interval="none"}, \code{interval="prediction"} (prediction intervals)
#' and \code{interval="confidence"} (intervals for the point forecast). The other options
#' are not supported and do not make much sense for the refitted model.
#' @param level Confidence level. Defines width of prediction interval.
#' @param side Defines, whether to provide \code{"both"} sides of prediction
#' interval or only \code{"upper"}, or \code{"lower"}.
#' @param cumulative If \code{TRUE}, then the cumulative forecast and prediction
#' interval are produced instead of the normal ones. This is useful for
#' inventory control systems.
#' @param ... Other parameters passed to \code{reapply()} and \code{mean()} functions in case of
#' \code{reforecast} (\code{trim} parameter in \code{mean()} is set to
#' 0.01 by default) and to \code{vcov} in case of \code{reapply}.
#' @return \code{reapply()} returns object of the class "reapply", which contains:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{timeElapsed} - Time elapsed for the code execution;
#' \item \code{y} - The actual values;
#' \item \code{states} - The array of states of the model;
#' \item \code{refitted} - The matrix with fitted values, where columns correspond
#' to different paths;
#' \item \code{fitted} - The vector of fitted values (conditional mean);
#' \item \code{model} - The name of the constructed model;
#' \item \code{transition} - The array of transition matrices;
#' \item \code{measurement} - The array of measurement matrices;
#' \item \code{persistence} - The matrix of persistence vectors (paths in columns);
#' \item \code{profile} - The array of profiles obtained by the end of each fit.
#' }
#'
